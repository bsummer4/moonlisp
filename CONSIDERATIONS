# Considerations
## ‘return’ can't be allowed in the Internal Representation
We compile statements into expressions like this:
	STMT → (λ()return STMT)()
Any return statements inside of STMT will expect to return to the surrounding
	block, but they will not. Since there is no way around this, we cannot
	support return statements.

TODO Using duplicate keys in a table should be a syntax error.
TODO Lua code generation is ugly and probably not completely correct.
	TODO It would be nicer if integers were output without the trailing '.0'.
	TODO Invalid variables names are possible.
	TODO String output isn't quoted correctly.
	TODO The temp variable name can be used for real variables.
	TODO Excessive use of lambda.
	TODO Using tmp variables everywhere is ugly, although
		fixing this would probably be too complicated to be worth it.
	TODO If statements generate incorrect code.
		They return from both branches (return from the function they are in).
		Both branches generate their own tmp variables.
	TODO Verify code-generation with the Lua reference manual.

TODO The REPL chokes on parens in string literals.
TODO Merge SET and ASSIGN in the IR.
TODO Separate ‘IR.hs’ from the IR→Lua transformation.
	Compilation code should go in ‘IRLua.hs’ ‘IRPython.hs’ and ‘IRJS.hs’.

TODO Install node.js
TODO Write a ‘JS.hs’ mirroring ‘Lua.hs’
TODO Get a working Javascript REPL using s-expression syntax.
TODO Write a ‘Python.hs’ mirroring ‘Lua.hs’
TODO Get a working Python REPL using s-expression syntax.
TODO Rework the IR:
	It should support all the features common to all back-ends with
		minimal added niceness.

TODO Add s-expression support to the IR
TODO Write compilers from the IR to Python, Lua, and JS.
TODO Add features to IR.hs
	Pattern matching

Lua code generation is ugly and probably not completely correct.
	Invalid variables names are possible.
	String output isn't quoted correctly.
	Too many (((parens))).
	All-in-one-line.
	The temp variable name can be used for real variables.
	There are probably lots more issues.

Merge SET and ASSIGN in the IR.
Separate ‘IR.hs’ from the IR→Lua transformation.
	Compilation code should go in ‘IRLua.hs’ ‘IRPython.hs’ and ‘IRJS.hs’.

Install node.js
Write a ‘JS.hs’ mirroring ‘Lua.hs’
Get a working Javascript REPL using s-expression syntax.
Write a ‘Python.hs’ mirroring ‘Lua.hs’
Get a working Python REPL using s-expression syntax.
Rework the IR:
	It should support all the features common to all back-ends with
		minimal added niceness.

Add s-expression support to the IR
Write compilers from the IR to Python, Lua, and JS.
Add features to IR.hs
	Pattern matching
	String-based and function-based FFIs.
	Macros

Lua code generation is ugly and probably not completely correct.
Handle EOF from ‘readChar’.
Merge SET and ASSIGN in the IR.
Make the Lua code-generator produce prettier code.
	I'm wasting a lot of time on mentally lexing the output.

Add some safety-checks:
	Lua backend should reject invalid variable names.
	Reject variable names that clash with our temp variable.

Separate ‘IR.hs’ from the IR→Lua transformation.
	Compilation code should go in ‘IRLua.hs’ ‘IRPython.hs’ and ‘IRJS.hs’.

Install node.js
Write a ‘JS.hs’ mirroring ‘Lua.hs’
Get a working Javascript REPL using s-expression syntax.
Write a ‘Python.hs’ mirroring ‘Lua.hs’
Get a working Python REPL using s-expression syntax.
Rework the IR:
	It should support all the features common to all back-ends with
		minimal added niceness.

Add s-expression support to the IR
Write compilers from the IR to Python, Lua, and JS.
Add features to IR.hs
	Pattern matching
	String-based and function-based FFIs.
	Macros
